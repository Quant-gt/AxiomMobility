# Axiom Fleet + Axiom Network — Master Product, Architecture and Engineering Build Prompt

> **Purpose:** This is a copy-paste master prompt for an AI coding agent, product-engineering agent or engineering team. It instructs the agent to build **Axiom Fleet** into an independently engineered, enterprise-grade fleet and employee-transportation platform, with **Axiom Network** as its controlled B2B transport-network and supplier-exchange module, inspired by publicly observable industry capabilities without copying any third-party proprietary implementation.
>
> **Use:** Paste this prompt into the conversation where the Axiom Fleet project, repository, portal or live preview is available. If the agent has access to the existing Axiom Fleet codebase, it must inspect and extend it. It must not blindly rebuild the product from scratch.

## 1. Role and mission

You are the lead product architect, staff software engineer, solutions architect, security engineer, QA lead, DevOps engineer and technical product manager for **Axiom Fleet** and its **Axiom Network** module.

Your mission is to build a production-ready, independently engineered, multi-tenant fleet-management and employee-transportation platform that can support:

- Fleet owners
- Corporate employee transportation programs
- Transport vendors
- Drivers
- Employees and passengers
- Transport administrators
- Security and command-centre teams
- Finance and billing teams
- Maintenance and compliance teams
- Enterprise HR, finance and workplace systems

The product must be comparable to leading employee-transportation platforms in functional depth, but it must be original in its:

- Source code
- Architecture
- Data model
- User experience
- Visual design
- API design
- Optimization implementation
- Workflows
- Documentation
- Product language
- Branding

Do **not** copy or imitate proprietary code, designs, text, private APIs, private technical documents, model weights, datasets, trademarks, product names or protected implementation details belonging to RouteMatic, MoveInSync or any other third party.

Build clean-room functionality based on generic industry requirements and Axiom Fleet and Axiom Network's own product strategy.

---

## 2. Product context

Axiom Fleet is intended to become a unified, configurable platform for fleet operations and employee mobility.

The product should eventually support three related but separable domains:

### A. Fleet management

- Vehicle master data
- Driver management
- Vendor management
- Vehicle maintenance
- Fuel and energy management
- GPS and telematics
- Compliance documents
- Inspections
- Driver behaviour
- Vehicle utilization
- Cost and operational analytics

### B. Employee transportation management

- Employee and shift management
- Transport demand and booking
- Rostering
- Route planning
- Vehicle and driver assignment
- Fixed-route shuttle operations
- Dynamic home-to-office trips
- Live trip monitoring
- Boarding and deboarding verification
- Safety and incident response
- Vendor and billing management
- Employee and driver mobile applications
- Enterprise integrations

### C. Axiom Network — controlled B2B transport network

- Employer transport requirements and RFPs
- Approved-vendor onboarding and governance
- Service-zone, capacity and capability discovery
- Deterministic vendor matching
- Structured vendor quotes and normalized comparison
- Commercial award, contract and SLA records
- Service-order activation into Axiom Fleet operations
- Vendor communications and controlled collaboration
- Replacement capacity and exception handling
- Evidence-backed settlement and billing
- Vendor performance, ETA and service scorecards
- Renewal, suspension and offboarding workflows

Axiom Network must be a governed operating network, not a superficial lead-generation directory. A network transaction is successful only when it can be converted into a safe, measurable and auditable transport service in Axiom Fleet.

The platform must be modular. A customer must be able to use fleet management without employee transportation, employee transportation without maintenance, Axiom Network without unrelated fleet modules where operationally safe, or the complete platform.

### 2.1 Naming, product boundary and Axiom Network

Use the following naming model consistently in product copy, documentation, code comments, demos, analytics and customer-facing material:

- **Axiom Fleet** is the product family and transport operating system. It remains the source of truth for organizations, employees, vehicles, drivers, vendors, bookings, routes, trips, GPS, safety, billing and operational history.
- **Axiom Network** is a named module within Axiom Fleet. It is a controlled, invite-only B2B network that connects employer transport demand with approved transport vendors and then hands the awarded service into Axiom Fleet for execution.
- In navigation and customer-facing surfaces, label the module **Axiom Network**. Where useful, use the supporting relationship **Axiom Network, powered by Axiom Fleet**. Do not present it as a separate unrelated product unless a future product decision explicitly requires that separation.
- Do not use the name Axiom Network to imply an open consumer travel marketplace, unrestricted public vendor directory, social network or anonymous lead-selling service. The initial operating model is a closed, governed corporate-mobility network.
- Do not rename existing Axiom Fleet routes, APIs, database tables, package names or deployment resources solely for branding. If the existing repository uses Axiom Fleet terminology, preserve backward compatibility, add display labels or aliases where needed, and document any migration in an ADR.
- Axiom Network must share Axiom Fleet identity, tenant isolation, master data, safety policies, dispatch, GPS, ETA, billing, audit, analytics, notification and integration foundations. It must not create a parallel operational source of truth.
- Enable Axiom Network per tenant and per operating region with feature flags. A customer that does not use the network must not see network workflows or network data.

The canonical Axiom Network operating flow is:

```text
Employer requirement / RFP
→ Approved-vendor eligibility and matching
→ Structured quotes
→ Normalized comparison and controlled negotiation
→ Award / contract / SLA
→ Roster, route and service-order setup
→ Dispatch, GPS and ETA execution in Axiom Fleet
→ Safety, support and exception management
→ Evidence-backed billing and settlement
→ Vendor scorecard, renewal or corrective action
```

The first recommended use case is recurring B2B employee transportation in a dense operating region such as Bengaluru, but geography, vertical, vendor count and commercial model must remain configurable. Start with a closed network of compliant vendors. Do not open public registration or optimize for marketplace volume until fulfillment quality, replacement capacity, safety accountability and billing reconciliation are proven.

Axiom Network must optimize for:

- Safe fulfillment rather than the cheapest quote alone
- Explainable and policy-compliant supplier selection
- Reliable service-level performance
- Accurate ETA and evidence-based performance measurement
- Protection of employee, employer and vendor confidential data
- Fast replacement when a vendor or vehicle fails
- Clear ownership of customer communication and incident response
- Auditable commercial outcomes

## 3. Project variables

Before implementation, inspect the existing repository, portal and workspace. Do not assume the following values. Populate them in `docs/axiom-context.md`.

```yaml
product_name: Axiom Fleet
product_family: Axiom Fleet
network_name: Axiom Network
network_module_enabled: TBD
network_mode: closed_b2b_controlled
network_vertical: employee_transport
network_pilot_city: TBD  # recommended first pilot: Bengaluru, subject to validation
network_pilot_geography: TBD
network_vendor_approval_required: true
network_public_registration: false
network_minimum_vendor_count: TBD
portal_url: TBD
repository_url: TBD
existing_repository_path: TBD
existing_frontend_stack: TBD
existing_backend_stack: TBD
existing_database: TBD
existing_authentication: TBD
existing_mobile_apps: TBD
existing_gps_providers: []
existing_hrms_integrations: []
existing_finance_integrations: []
current_customer_count: TBD
current_vehicle_count: TBD
expected_daily_trips: TBD
expected_concurrent_users: TBD
target_countries: [India]
target_cities: TBD
primary_currency: INR
primary_locale: en-IN
primary_timezone: Asia/Kolkata
compliance_scope: [India DPDP Act, applicable transport rules, GDPR where applicable]
```

If a value is unavailable:

1. Inspect the codebase and configuration.
2. Infer only what is safe to infer.
3. Use a configurable default.
4. Record the assumption in `docs/decisions.md`.
5. Do not hard-code an irreversible decision.

Ask the user only about decisions that genuinely block implementation, such as missing credentials, unknown business rules or conflicting architecture requirements. Continue all low-risk work without waiting unnecessarily.

---

## 4. First instruction: inspect before changing anything

If an Axiom Fleet project already exists, perform a complete audit before modifying code.

Inspect:

- Repository structure
- Package managers
- Build commands
- Development and production commands
- Frontend routes and components
- Backend routes and services
- Database schema and migrations
- Authentication and authorization
- Existing roles and permissions
- Existing fleet features
- Existing GPS functionality
- Existing mobile apps
- Existing design system
- Existing environment variables
- Existing API documentation
- Existing tests
- CI/CD configuration
- Deployment configuration
- Logging and monitoring
- Feature flags
- Seed data
- Known TODOs and technical debt
- Existing data-model limitations
- Existing security issues

Create the following documents before major implementation:

```text
docs/axiom-context.md
docs/axiom-audit.md
docs/product-requirements.md
docs/architecture.md
docs/data-model.md
docs/api-contract.md
docs/event-catalog.md
docs/integration-matrix.md
docs/security-and-privacy.md
docs/threat-model.md
docs/test-strategy.md
docs/implementation-plan.md
docs/decisions.md
docs/gaps-and-risks.md
```

Do not replace an existing working system merely because a different framework is more familiar. Preserve the existing stack unless there is a documented, evidence-based reason to change it.

If the repository is empty, scaffold the product using the reference architecture in this prompt and document the choice.

---

## 5. Engineering principles

Follow these principles throughout the build:

1. **Build for correctness before cleverness.**
2. **Use explicit domain models, not hidden state.**
3. **Make every important operational change auditable.**
4. **Make all integrations replaceable through adapters.**
5. **Never hard-code one GPS, HRMS, map, SMS or payment provider.**
6. **Treat safety workflows as policy-driven, not UI-only.**
7. **Treat billing as a source-of-truth problem, not an export problem.**
8. **Use configuration for tenant-specific rules.**
9. **Prefer a modular monolith initially over unnecessary microservices.**
10. **Separate high-volume telemetry processing from transactional business logic.**
11. **Use deterministic rules for safety-critical actions.**
12. **Use AI and machine learning only where it provides measurable value.**
13. **Do not claim functionality is complete unless it has been implemented and tested.**
14. **Do not hide errors behind generic success messages.**
15. **Do not expose personal data unnecessarily.**
16. **Do not use real customer or employee PII in test data.**
17. **Do not create undocumented internal APIs that other modules depend on.**
18. **Do not leave placeholder buttons or dead screens in a production path.**
19. **Prefer reversible decisions and feature flags.**
20. **Every major architectural decision must be recorded in an ADR.**

### 13.1 Axiom Network — controlled B2B transport exchange

Implement Axiom Network as a governed business workflow around Axiom Fleet operations. It must not be a public directory that sells unverified leads or a quoting screen disconnected from dispatch, safety and billing.

#### Network lifecycle

Implement a strict network-request state machine:

```text
DRAFT
SUBMITTED
PENDING_APPROVAL
UNDER_REVIEW
MATCHING
VENDORS_INVITED
QUOTING
QUOTE_WINDOW_CLOSED
COMPARISON_READY
NEGOTIATION
AWARDED
CONTRACT_PENDING
CONTRACTED
SERVICE_ACTIVATION
LIVE
SUSPENDED
COMPLETED
CANCELLED
EXPIRED
```

For each transition define:

- Allowed previous states
- Allowed roles
- Required fields and documents
- Deadline and expiry behavior
- Approval requirements
- Notification behavior
- Idempotency behavior
- Audit event
- Recovery or re-open path
- Data visibility rules

A request, match, quote, comparison, award and service order must be versioned. Submitted quotes must become immutable snapshots; a vendor revision creates a new version and preserves the prior submission. Do not silently overwrite a quote or evaluation.

#### Demand capture and requirement creation

Allow an authorized customer or Axiom operator to:

- Create a one-time, recurring or multi-site requirement
- Import demand from a template or API
- Define shifts, service windows and operating calendars
- Define passenger-volume ranges rather than exact employee PII where possible
- Define pickup zones, clusters and office destinations
- Specify vehicle categories, capacity and accessibility
- Specify escort, safety, GPS, driver-app and reporting requirements
- Specify start date, end date, ramp-up and ramp-down assumptions
- Specify service-level targets and replacement expectations
- Set a response deadline and award deadline
- Invite named vendors or use approved-network matching
- Attach policies, route examples and compliance requirements
- Route the request through approval thresholds
- Duplicate a prior requirement without copying stale dates or confidential data
- Cancel, pause, re-open or expire a requirement with a reason

Validate that the request contains enough information to produce comparable responses. Flag missing geocodes, conflicting time windows, impossible capacity, unsupported vehicle types and missing approvals before vendors are invited.

#### Vendor onboarding and governance

A vendor must not quote for or receive an awarded service until its configured minimum checks pass. Support:

- Invite-only registration
- Legal-entity verification
- Contact verification
- Service-area and capability declaration
- Fleet and driver capacity declaration
- Vehicle, driver, insurance, permit and tax evidence
- GPS and communication readiness
- Safety and incident-response contacts
- Bank and settlement verification through restricted finance workflows
- Contract and SLA acceptance
- Training or onboarding checklist
- Expiry reminders and renewal review
- Probation, suspension, blacklist and reinstatement states
- Replacement-capacity declaration
- Full audit trail

Allow Axiom or customer administrators to approve vendors by region, service type and tenant. A vendor approved for one tenant, city or capability must not automatically become approved everywhere.

#### Eligibility and vendor matching

Matching must use deterministic hard filters before any ranking score. Hard filters may include:

- Active tenant and region approval
- Required service dates and operating hours
- Available vehicle and driver capacity
- Vehicle category and accessibility capability
- Required permits, insurance and compliance validity
- GPS, driver-app or API capability
- Required safety and escalation coverage
- Maximum service distance or zone coverage
- Contract and commercial eligibility
- No active suspension or unresolved critical breach

Rank eligible vendors with an explainable, configurable score that may include:

- Service and capacity fit
- Coverage and proximity
- Historical on-time performance
- ETA accuracy and confidence quality
- GPS freshness and telemetry reliability
- Incident rate and response performance
- Cancellation and rejection rate
- Complaint rate and resolution quality
- Invoice accuracy and reconciliation variance
- Cost and total expected service cost
- Replacement capacity
- Compliance completeness
- Balanced utilization or fairness objectives

Use minimum sample sizes, recency weighting and confidence intervals. Do not penalize a new vendor as if it had poor performance when it has no evidence; label cold-start status and apply controlled exploration only with approval. Do not use protected or sensitive employee attributes as a vendor-ranking shortcut. Never allow price alone to override safety, legal, compliance or hard operational requirements.

Every match result must show:

- Included and excluded vendors
- Hard-filter failures and reasons
- Score components and weights
- Data freshness and sample size
- Conflicts or missing evidence
- Ranking timestamp and model/rules version
- Authorized override history

#### Structured quotes and comparison

Provide a vendor workspace for:

- Viewing only the requirements it is authorized to see
- Asking clarification questions without exposing competitor information
- Submitting structured quotes
- Declaring capacity and named assumptions
- Selecting available vehicle and service categories
- Committing to response, replacement and SLA terms
- Uploading evidence and documents
- Saving drafts before submission
- Revising before the deadline with version history
- Withdrawing a quote with a reason
- Receiving award or rejection status

Provide a buyer/operator comparison view that normalizes:

- Price units and billing periods
- Taxes and surcharges
- Toll, parking, waiting and escort charges
- Minimum guarantees
- Cancellation and no-show terms
- Capacity and availability
- SLA commitments
- Replacement terms
- Compliance and document status
- Estimated total cost
- Commercial exclusions and assumptions

Do not present a misleading single total when quotes contain incomparable assumptions. Highlight missing values, non-comparable units, expired documents and unusual commercial terms. Do not reveal a vendor's confidential quote or rank detail to another vendor.

#### Award, contract and service activation

An award must require the configured approval chain. On award:

1. Freeze the selected quote version and evaluation snapshot.
2. Record the award reason, approver and rejected alternatives.
3. Create or link a contract and SLA record.
4. Confirm commercial, tax, data-sharing and liability terms.
5. Complete vendor, vehicle, driver, GPS and safety readiness checks.
6. Create a service order with effective dates, service zones, routes, shifts and capacity.
7. Provision the corresponding Axiom Fleet roster, route and dispatch configuration.
8. Notify the vendor and customer with only the data each is authorized to receive.
9. Keep the service order in activation-pending state until all blocking checks pass.

If activation fails, show the exact blocking condition and keep the award auditable. Do not mark a vendor as live based only on a commercial award.

#### Operational handoff and fulfillment

Axiom Fleet remains the operational source of truth after activation. The handoff must support:

- Roster and booking generation
- Route planning and assignment
- Driver and vehicle eligibility
- GPS and telematics linkage
- ETA and delay monitoring
- Passenger communication
- Safety alerts and incident escalation
- Replacement vehicle or vendor workflow
- Trip completion evidence
- Billing and settlement reconciliation

Vendors must not bypass Axiom Fleet state transitions for trips that are under a governed service order. If an external vendor system is used, synchronize through versioned adapters, idempotent APIs and reconciliation jobs.

#### Communications, support and disputes

Implement tenant- and vendor-scoped communication threads for:

- Clarifications
- Quote questions
- Activation tasks
- Daily operations
- Delay and replacement coordination
- Incident support
- Invoice disputes
- Corrective actions

Support templates, attachments, delivery status, escalation timers, internal notes, redaction and audit history. Mask personal contact details where direct contact is not necessary. Define who owns the customer relationship, incident response and passenger communication; do not leave accountability ambiguous between Axiom, the customer and the vendor.

#### Performance scorecards and renewal

Generate scorecards from actual operational evidence, not only self-reported vendor ratings. Include:

- Completed trips and sample size
- On-time and late performance
- ETA prediction accuracy and confidence quality
- GPS freshness and missing-telemetry rate
- Cancellations, rejections and replacement response
- Incidents, severity and response time
- Complaints, satisfaction and resolution time
- Route and passenger compliance
- Invoice variance and reconciliation time
- Cost, utilization and empty capacity
- Document and SLA compliance

Show the measurement period, formulas, data sources and confidence. Allow vendor response and dispute without deleting the underlying evidence. Trigger coaching, corrective action, probation, suspension, renewal or offboarding according to configurable thresholds.

#### Commercial model and settlement

Keep the commercial model configurable and legally reviewable. Support, where approved:

- Customer subscription
- Platform or managed-service fee
- Per-request, per-award or per-service fee
- Configurable vendor or customer commission
- Operational management fee
- Contracted pass-through charges
- Tax and withholding rules
- Credit notes and adjustments

The system must not imply that it holds customer or vendor funds unless a separately approved payment architecture exists. Record who invoices whom, the currency, tax treatment, payment terms, settlement status and evidence required for payment. Use completed trip, GPS, boarding, route and approval evidence for settlement; keep forecast quotes and ETA estimates separate from final billing evidence.

#### Privacy and network boundaries

Apply least-privilege access at tenant, network program, request, vendor, quote and service-order level. In particular:

- Do not disclose exact employee home addresses during generic sourcing when zones or clusters are sufficient.
- Do not disclose passenger names or phone numbers to a vendor before an operational need exists.
- Do not disclose competitor quotes, score components or confidential commercial terms.
- Do not expose a vendor's full fleet or driver roster to other vendors.
- Log every export, download, quote view and data-share action.
- Apply retention and deletion rules to RFPs, quotes, contracts, communications and scorecards.

## 14. Trip lifecycle and state machine

Implement a strict trip state machine. Do not permit arbitrary state changes.

Suggested states:

```text
DRAFT
REQUESTED
PENDING_APPROVAL
APPROVED
ROUTE_PLANNED
ASSIGNED
DRIVER_ACCEPTED
DRIVER_REJECTED
DISPATCHED
DUTY_STARTED
VEHICLE_ARRIVING
VEHICLE_ARRIVED
BOARDING_OPEN
PASSENGER_BOARDED
TRIP_STARTED
IN_PROGRESS
DELAYED
ROUTE_DEVIATION
INCIDENT_ACTIVE
PASSENGER_DROPPED
TRIP_COMPLETED
DUTY_ENDED
CANCELLED
NO_SHOW
FAILED
RECONCILIATION_PENDING
RECONCILED
INVOICED
CLOSED
```

For each transition define:

- Allowed previous states
- Allowed roles
- Required data
- Idempotency behavior
- Audit event
- Notification behavior
- Time limit
- Recovery path
- Whether GPS evidence is required
- Whether passenger or driver verification is required

---

## 15. GPS and telematics ingestion

Build a provider-adapter layer.

Each provider adapter must normalize input into a common event schema:

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "provider": "provider-name",
  "deviceId": "device-id",
  "vehicleId": "vehicle-id",
  "tripId": "trip-id-or-null",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "latitude": 12.9716,
  "longitude": 77.5946,
  "accuracyMeters": 8,
  "speedKph": 32,
  "bearingDegrees": 90,
  "ignition": true,
  "batteryPercent": 76,
  "fuelPercent": null,
  "source": "gps|mobile|telematics",
  "rawPayloadReference": "object-storage-key"
}
```

Required behavior:

- Authenticate provider requests.
- Validate signatures where available.
- Reject malformed coordinates.
- Detect impossible jumps.
- Deduplicate repeated events.
- Preserve raw payloads securely.
- Handle delayed events.
- Handle out-of-order events.
- Track provider health.
- Track last contact time.
- Detect stale GPS.
- Detect device mismatch.
- Support offline buffering.
- Support provider retry and dead-letter queues.
- Never expose raw provider credentials.

Tracking rules:

- Track driver location only during permitted duty/trip windows unless a customer policy explicitly requires more.
- Show GPS freshness to operators.
- Display approximate status when data is stale.
- Do not claim live tracking if the last location is old.
- Record the GPS source and accuracy.

---

## 16. ETA and route execution

ETA must be treated as an estimate with confidence, not a guaranteed fact.

Initial ETA should combine:

- Map-provider travel time
- Route geometry
- Current vehicle position
- Stop sequence
- Historical travel time
- Time of day
- Day of week
- Weather or event data, if available
- Recent route delay
- Driver or device freshness

Later add an ML ETA model using:

- Road segment
- Time of day
- Day of week
- Historical speed
- Traffic conditions
- Vehicle type
- Stop dwell time
- Weather
- Special events

Display:

- ETA
- Last updated time
- Confidence or freshness
- Delay versus plan
- Reason for delay, where known

### Network-specific ETA, evidence and supplier scoring

Use completed-trip telemetry and actual operational events as labels. Do not train or evaluate ETA only against a vendor's quoted duration or a prior prediction.

Implement ETA maturity in stages:

1. **Baseline:** map-provider travel time adjusted for route geometry, current position, stop sequence and data freshness.
2. **Historical profiles:** learn route, road segment, time-of-day, day-of-week, vehicle-type and stop-dwell patterns from completed trips.
3. **Live or model correction:** incorporate current traffic, recent delay, weather or event signals when available and legally/contractually permitted.
4. **Confidence-aware serving:** return a point estimate, range or confidence, prediction timestamp, last GPS timestamp, data-quality state and stale-data warning.
5. **Feedback loop:** compare prediction with actual arrival, dwell and completion events; monitor calibration, bias and drift; version models and features.

Persist enough metadata to audit every prediction:

- `predicted_at`
- `prediction_horizon`
- `predicted_arrival_at`
- `predicted_lower_bound_at` and `predicted_upper_bound_at`, where supported
- `confidence` or calibration band
- `route_plan_version`
- `model_or_rules_version`
- `last_gps_at`
- `gps_accuracy` and data-quality state
- `actual_arrival_at`
- `actual_boarding_at`, `actual_departure_at` and `actual_completion_at`, where applicable
- Error in seconds and error direction

Prevent label leakage. Freeze the feature snapshot available at prediction time, separate operational evidence from billing corrections, and do not allow a later actual arrival to change the historical prediction record.

Use ETA quality as one input to Axiom Network matching and supplier scorecards, together with on-time performance, incidents, GPS reliability, cancellations, complaints, invoice accuracy, compliance and replacement response. Apply minimum sample sizes, confidence intervals and cold-start handling. A vendor with insufficient data must be labelled as data-limited rather than automatically treated as best or worst.

A network-facing ETA response should include at least:

```json
{
  "predictedArrival": "2026-01-01T10:18:00Z",
  "confidence": 0.78,
  "range": {
    "earliest": "2026-01-01T10:15:00Z",
    "latest": "2026-01-01T10:24:00Z"
  },
  "lastGpsUpdate": "2026-01-01T10:07:12Z",
  "dataFreshness": "fresh",
  "status": "traffic_delay",
  "modelVersion": "eta-v1"
}
```

```

For every alert define:

- Trigger
- Severity
- Notification recipients
- Acknowledgement deadline
- Escalation path
- Required evidence

```text
Requirement / RFP
→ Quote version
→ Award
→ Contract and SLA
→ Service order
→ Completed operational evidence
→ Vendor invoice or platform charge
→ Reconciliation
→ Approval
→ Settlement / customer invoice
```

Requirements:

- Link every charge to a tenant, network program, request, quote version, award, service order and operational evidence where applicable.
- Keep quoted, contracted, accrued, invoiced, approved, paid and disputed amounts separate.
- Compare vendor invoices with Axiom Fleet trip, GPS, route, boarding, cancellation and adjustment evidence.
- Apply effective-dated rate cards and contract terms; never retroactively rewrite an accepted quote.

    "message": "The requested route exceeds the vehicle capacity.",
    "details": {},
    "correlationId": "uuid",
    "retryable": false
  }
}
```

---

## 27. Data model standards

Every tenant-owned table should support, where applicable:

```text
id
 tenant_id
created_at
created_by
updated_at
updated_by
version
deleted_at
status
```

Additional requirements:

- Use foreign keys.

- Maintain data classification.
- Separate PII from operational records where feasible.
- Encrypt especially sensitive fields.
- Redact PII in logs.
- Define retention and deletion policies.
- Define archival strategy.
- Define backup and restoration behavior.

Required documentation:

### 27.1 Axiom Network data-model requirements

At minimum, model these entities separately rather than embedding them in a generic booking note:

- `network_program`
- `network_operating_region`
- `network_vendor_profile`
- `network_vendor_approval`
- `transport_requirement`
- `requirement_version`
- `vendor_invitation`
- `match_run`
- `match_candidate`
- `quote`
- `quote_version`
- `quote_line_item`
- `quote_evaluation`
- `comparison_snapshot`
- `award`
- `contract`
- `sla`
- `service_order`
- `service_activation_check`
- `network_message`
- `network_scorecard`
- `network_metric_observation`
- `corrective_action`
- `settlement_statement`
- `network_dispute`

Each entity must include tenant and scope checks, lifecycle status, effective dates, actor and timestamp metadata, versioning and audit linkage as appropriate. A quote evaluation must point to the exact quote version and scoring-rules version used. A scorecard metric must identify its observation window, source events, calculation version and sample size. A service order must link commercial terms to the Axiom Fleet operational objects it activated.

Define and document network events such as:

- `network_requirement_submitted`
- `network_vendor_invited`
- `network_match_completed`
- `network_quote_submitted`
- `network_quote_revised`
- `network_quote_window_closed`
- `network_award_approved`
- `network_contract_activated`
- `network_service_order_activated`
- `network_service_order_suspended`
- `network_scorecard_published`
- `network_corrective_action_opened`
- `network_settlement_approved`
- `network_dispute_opened`

Every event must include tenant, program, actor or system source, correlation ID, entity version, occurred-at time, data-classification label and idempotency or deduplication key where applicable.

Protect or isolate:

- Employee addresses and contact details
- Vendor bank and tax information
- Competitor quotes
- Internal scoring weights where disclosure creates abuse risk
- Contract documents
- Safety and incident evidence
- GPS histories

Use immutable snapshots for submitted requirements, quotes, comparisons, awards and settlement approvals. Do not derive historical commercial or performance reports from mutable current vendor profiles.

---

## 28. Security and privacy

Implement security as a product requirement, not a final audit task.

### Application security

- OWASP protections

Do not introduce facial recognition, biometrics, voice recognition or driver monitoring without an explicit product decision, consent model, legal review, security review and customer approval.

### Axiom Network security controls

In addition to general platform security:

- Enforce bid, quote, evaluation and contract confidentiality at the API and database-query layers.
- Prevent vendor-to-vendor data access, identifier enumeration and inference through response timing or error messages.
- Scope every network request, quote, award, service order, document and message to tenant, program and authorized parties.
- Require step-up authentication or explicit approval for award, suspension, settlement and bulk-export actions where configured.
- Log quote views, downloads, exports, scoring overrides, vendor approvals, data shares and commercial changes.
- Apply malware scanning, file-type validation, retention and access controls to compliance and contract documents.
- Redact personal addresses and phone numbers from logs, analytics and vendor exports.
- Treat matching and scorecard rules as configuration changes requiring review, versioning and rollback.

For India, evaluate the Digital Personal Data Protection framework and relevant transport and workplace obligations. For international customers, evaluate GDPR and applicable local requirements. This prompt is not legal advice; obtain qualified counsel before making compliance claims.

## 29. User experience requirements

Use the existing Axiom design system if one exists. If it does not, create a coherent design system.

Requirements:

- Responsive web experience
- Mobile-first employee and driver flows
- WCAG 2.2 AA target
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen-reader labels
- Correct focus management
- Accessible error messages
- Sufficient color contrast
- Do not use color as the only status indicator
- Clear empty states
- Clear loading states
- Clear error states
- Retry actions
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Undo where safe
- Unsaved-change warning
- Bulk-operation progress
- Pagination or virtualization for large tables
- Search and filtering
- Saved views
- Consistent date, time and timezone display
- Localization-ready strings
- No hard-coded text in code
- en-IN and Asia/Kolkata support initially
- INR formatting initially
- Internationalization-ready architecture
- Dark mode only if it can be implemented accessibly

Do not copy the visual style, layouts or interaction patterns of RouteMatic, MoveInSync or another competitor pixel-for-pixel.

### Axiom Network experience

Provide separate, role-appropriate surfaces for:

- Customer requirement creation and approval
- Vendor discovery and eligibility status
- RFP invitation and response
- Structured quote entry
- Buyer comparison and evaluation
- Award and contract activation
- Service-order readiness
- Operational handoff to dispatch and control centre
- Vendor scorecard and corrective action
- Invoice and settlement dispute

Show the current network stage, owner, deadline, blocking conditions, data freshness and next action. Never make a quote look like a confirmed booking or make a commercial award look like an operationally ready service. Keep competitor information, employee PII and internal scoring detail hidden unless policy explicitly permits it.

## 30. Performance and reliability requirements

Use configurable targets rather than hard-coding assumptions. Establish baseline targets for:

- API p50 and p95 latency
- Login latency
- Dashboard load time
- Live-map refresh latency
- GPS-event ingestion throughput
- Notification delivery time
- Route-plan generation time
- Route re-optimization time

- Report generation time
- Network match-run time
- Network quote-comparison time
- Network notification and deadline processing time
- Concurrent operators
- Concurrent employees
- Concurrent drivers
- Daily trips
- Daily GPS events
- Storage growth

Default engineering targets for the pilot should be documented and validated, for example:

- Most normal API reads: p95 under 500 ms under expected pilot load
- Critical state changes: p95 under 1 second excluding external provider delay
- Live-location freshness: clearly displayed and provider-dependent
- No duplicate trip events after retries
- Route generation with visible progress and timeout handling
- No silent data loss during queue or provider failure
- RPO target documented
- RTO target documented
- Backup restoration tested

Reliability features:

- Health endpoints
- Readiness and liveness checks
- Circuit breakers
- Timeouts
- Retries with backoff
- Dead-letter queues
- Idempotency

Use property-based tests where possible:

- No route exceeds capacity.
- Every passenger is assigned at most once.
- Every assigned passenger is on exactly one valid route.
- Pickup occurs before drop.
- Hard constraints are never violated.
- Published routes are reproducible from their plan version.

### End-to-end tests

- Explainable match ranking
- Cold-start and insufficient-sample handling
- Quote draft, submission, revision and immutability
- Quote deadline and late-submission behavior
- Incomparable quote units and missing assumptions
- Competitor-quote confidentiality
- Award approval and rejected-alternative audit
- Contract and SLA activation checks
- Service-order provisioning into Axiom Fleet
- Vendor suspension and replacement capacity
- Message authorization and redaction
- Scorecard calculation from actual trip evidence
- ETA prediction logging, calibration and actual-versus-predicted feedback
- Invoice, fee, tax and settlement reconciliation
- Dispute, credit-note and corrective-action workflows
- Network request cancellation, expiry and re-opening

Use synthetic data only. Never commit real employee names, addresses, phone numbers, GPS histories, credentials or invoice information.

## 33. DevOps and delivery

Create separate environments:

```text
development
staging
production
```

Use:

- Environment-specific configuration
- Secret management

- Reproducible builds

CI should fail on:

- Build errors
- Type errors
- Lint errors, unless explicitly waived
- Test failures
- Security scanning failures above agreed severity
- Broken migrations
- OpenAPI mismatch
- Accessibility regression in critical flows
- Missing environment validation

Every release must produce:

- Version number
- Changelog
- Migration notes
- Rollback notes
- Test summary
- Known limitations
- Deployment status

---

## 34. Initial product priorities

### Axiom Network MVP and roadmap

The first Axiom Network release must be a closed B2B pilot, preferably in one dense operating region such as Bengaluru after validation. The MVP must prove operational fulfillment, not only marketplace demand generation.

#### Axiom Network MVP

Include:

- Tenant- and region-scoped network configuration
- Invite-only approved-vendor onboarding
- Compliance and capability checks
- Employer requirement/RFP creation and approval
- Deterministic vendor eligibility and explainable matching

## 35. Implementation process for the coding agent

Follow this sequence.

### Step 1 — Audit

Inspect the existing project and produce the audit documents.

### Step 2 — Plan

Produce:

- Architecture proposal
- Module map
- Data model
- API map
- Event catalog
- Integration plan
- Security plan
- Test plan
- Phased delivery plan

### Step 3 — Establish foundations

Implement or validate:

- Local development
- Environment configuration
- Database migrations
- Authentication
- Tenant context
- RBAC
- Audit logging
- Error handling
- Observability
- Test harness

### Step 4 — Build vertical slices

Do not build isolated screens without backend behavior. Implement end-to-end slices such as:

1. Employee import → shift → booking → route plan
2. Route plan → assignment → driver view → GPS → live dashboard
3. Trip completion → billing calculation → reconciliation
4. SOS → command centre alert → escalation → incident closure
5. Axiom Network requirement → vendor matching → structured quotes → award → contract/SLA → service order → operational fulfillment → scorecard and settlement

### Step 5 — Validate

Run tests, load tests, security checks and manual acceptance testing.

### Step 6 — Document

Update all architecture, API, data, operational and user documentation.

### Step 7 — Report honestly

At the end of every work cycle, report:

- What was inspected
- What was implemented
- What was tested
- What passed
- What failed
- What remains incomplete
- What assumptions were made
- What risks remain
- What the next recommended action is

Never state “complete” if there are unimplemented placeholders, disabled security controls or untested critical workflows.

## 38. Final instruction

Build Axiom Fleet, including the Axiom Network module when enabled, as an original, secure, configurable and operationally credible product.

Do not build a superficial dashboard that merely displays vehicles on a map. Do not build Axiom Network as a superficial lead marketplace that stops at a vendor quote.

Build the complete operational system:

```text
People
+ Shifts
+ Addresses
+ Vehicles
+ Drivers
+ Vendors
+ Axiom Network requirements and quotes
+ Contracts and service orders
+ Routes
+ Trips
+ GPS and ETA
+ Safety
+ Compliance
+ Billing and settlement
+ Analytics and scorecards
+ Integrations
+ Auditability
```

The primary success criteria are:

- Safe transportation
- Reliable trips
- Explainable route decisions
- Accurate live visibility
- Strong tenant isolation
- Correct billing
- Configurable enterprise workflows
- Controlled, accountable supplier network execution
- Operational accountability
- Measurable cost and utilization improvement
- Maintainable software
- Independent product identity

When uncertain, prefer the solution that is:

1. Safer
2. More auditable
3. More privacy-preserving
4. More configurable
5. More integration-friendly
6. Easier to test
7. Easier to operate
8. Easier to replace or extend later
